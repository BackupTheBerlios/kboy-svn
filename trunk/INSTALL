Kboy uses the cmake buildsystem to generate build files for several platforms.
In the buildprocess it replaces the good old "configure" script.

To build KBoy, do the following (from the KBoy source directory):

$ mkdir build && cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make

All generated files will be placed inside the build directory, so you can have
several platform builds on the same sources next to each other.

Use
cmake -G"[env]" ..
to generate build files for a specific build environment. See the cmake
documention for further information.

Now, a

$ make install

will spread all files to their positions in the system ;)


This program needs Qt4 in version 4.7 or higher. However, it might also compile
with older versions (but this has not been tested yet). To do that, open the file
CMakeLists.txt, look for a line like

find_package(Qt4 4.7 REQUIRED)

(near the top) and simply remove the "4.7" version string (or replace it
with the oldest version number you want to compile against).

If you have problems or any questions, don't hesitate to ask for help.
